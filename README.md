An AI uses the minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning to make the "best" move(s) given the state of the board.
User inputs if they want to start first (0) or second (1), AI becomes whichever player they didn't pick.
User has to input their moves as they play, the AI will give their sequence of moves at the end of their turn.
0-5 is the lower row of the board, 7-12 is the upper row of the board (from player 1's perspective).
